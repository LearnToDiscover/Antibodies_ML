### Imports and Requirements
The antibody encoding method we will be using is the Propythia program. Before starting we recommend installing it by copying and pasting the following command in your terminal/command line:

`pip install propythia`

The machine learning models that we will use are imported from the sklearn package. We also suggest installing this via the following command: 

`pip install sklearn`

As this is a large package, rather than importing the whole package, it is better practise to just import the fuctions we require. As this usually leaves with a lot of import statements, we have broken them down what imports are required at what stage of the process.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How may we create a machine learning classifier that can tell apart two groups of proteins?

- How may we improve upon the performance of a machine learning classifier that does not perform so well?

- How may we check for overfitting in a trained machine learning classifier?

- How may we pick the most relevant data points that are related to the class of a sample?

- Can we also train a deep learning predictor to tell proteins apart?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand how protein sequences can become readable to machine learning predictors

- Practise machine learning optimisation techniques including GridSearchCV and dimensionality reduction

- Check for overfitted data by testing with a totally naive dataset

- Pracitse prediction by applying a deep learning model to the problem and evaluating its performance

## Separating Mouse and Human Antibody Sequences using Protein Encoding and Machine Learning Classifiers







::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Protein sequences must be numerically encoded to be readable by machine learning algorithms.

- It is sometimes necessary to experiment with different machine learning classifiers or hyperparameterisation techniques, to achieve the best prediction results.

- Check the performance of your model with a "held back" dataset which was not included in the training set.
